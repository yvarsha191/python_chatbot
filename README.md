This is a python based chatbot to communicate with human and perform action similar to them. 
This is built using deep learning techniques. 
LSTM, a neural network is used to classify user message category and to give random response based on that. 
Technologies used- NLTK, Keras, Python 
The steps include- 
1) Processing data- Tokenizing and Lemmatizing
2) Training and Testing data- providing input pattern and getting output
3) Build the model- used Keras sequential API, deep neural network
4) Get the response - created function to identify class and retrieve random responses from list of responses ,used Tkinter library to develop GUI
5) Run chatbot
