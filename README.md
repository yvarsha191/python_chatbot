This is a Python-based chatbot to communicate with humans and perform similar actions. 
This is built using deep learning techniques. 
LSTM, a neural network is used to classify user message categories and to give random responses based on that. 
Technologies used- **NLTK, Keras, Python** 
The steps include- 
1) Processing data- Tokenizing and Lemmatizing
2) Training and Testing data- providing input pattern and getting output
3) Build the model- used Keras sequential API, deep neural network
4) Get the response - created a function to identify class and retrieve random responses from a list of responses , used **Tkinter library** to develop GUI
5) Run chatbot
