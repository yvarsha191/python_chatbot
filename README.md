Hello !!
This is a Python-based chatbot to communicates with humans and performs similar actions to them. 
It is built using deep learning techniques. 
LSTM, a neural network is used to classify user message categories and to give random responses based on that. 
Technologies used- **NLTK, Keras, Python** 
The steps include- 
1) Processing data- Tokenizing and Lemmatizing
2) Training and Testing data- providing input pattern and getting output
3) Build the model- used Keras sequential API, deep neural network
4) Get the response - created a function to identify class and retrieve random responses from a list of responses, used **Tkinter library** to develop GUI
5) To Run the chatbot- on the command prompt, write ''python chatgui.py'' and enter and enjoy talking with the bot.

To run the Chatbot-
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Run the file Chatgui.py and start messaging with the bot!!

Input Output Chat-
